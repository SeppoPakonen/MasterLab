# Momentum Loop Station Instrument Stub

## Reference
- Inspired by: Momentum
- Vendor: Big Fish Audio
- Source catalog: Momentum Pro

## Implementation Plan
### BigFishAudio Momentum Pro
- Category: loop workstation
- Sidechain: N/A
- Processing blueprint: Loop remix instrument featuring multi-layer slicing, elastic time-stretch, and performance macros.
- Key features:
  - Eight-layer engine with per-layer time/pitch stretch and reverse
  - Drag-and-drop audio to auto-slice with transient detection
  - Scene sequencer triggering stutter, gate, and filter patterns
  - Macro pads controlling FX racks and slice probability
- Core building blocks:
  - Sample::LoopPool, Sample::SliceEngine, Sample::TimeStretch, Sequencer::ClipGrid, UI::PerformancePads, FX::InsertRack
- Signal/voice flow: Trigger (pad/host) → Slice scheduler → Time-stretch/pitch engine → Layer mixer → FX rack → Output
- TODO:
  - Wire PluginSDK parameter/route scaffolding to match the modules above
  - Flesh out processing graph and automation surfaces per EFFECTS/INSTRUMENTS blueprint
