## U++ GUI Framework Details

### Splitter Components
There is no HSplitter and VSplitter in U++. Both are implemented as Splitter. You select the orientation mode with:
- `Horz()` for horizontal mode
- `Vert()` for vertical mode
These methods are called in the constructor.

### Vector Operations
Vectors in U++ are copied using the `<<=` operator. They don't have a `=` operator on purpose. 
You either:
- Move vectors with `pick(vector)`
- Deep copy vectors with `<<=`

### Component Types
- BitSet is implemented as Bits in U++
- There's no Row or ModKeys type in U++
- ArrayCtrl rows are edited directly with functions
