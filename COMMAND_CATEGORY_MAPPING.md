## Implementation Priority by Category

### High Priority (MVP Required)
1. File Operations (FileIO)
2. Edit Operations (ProjectMgmt)
3. Track Management (AudioCore)
4. Audio Processing (AudioOps)
5. MIDI Processing (MidiOps)
6. Transport Controls (TransportUI)
7. Preferences System (Preferences)

### Medium Priority (Enhanced Functionality)
1. Automation System (AudioCore)
2. Devices Management (Devices)
3. Mixer Operations (AudioCore)
4. Views System (Views)
5. Tools System (Editors/Tools)
6. Media Management (MediaPool)
7. Project Management (ProjectMgmt)

### Low Priority (Advanced Features)

- Context menu generation

### Persistence → FileIO/Preferences
- Project file serialization
- Preference storage
- Template management
- Backup and recovery

### Plugin Architecture → Devices
- Plugin discovery and loading
- Parameter automation
- GUI integration
- Real-time processing support

### Scripting Engine → Scripts
- Logical editor implementation
- Preset management
- Macro recording
- Script execution environment

## Dependencies and Integration Points

### Core Dependencies
1. ProjectMgmt → All other packages (command system)
2. AudioCore → Editors, FileIO, AudioOps, MidiOps
3. FileIO → All packages (import/export)
4. Preferences → All packages (configuration)

### UI Dependencies
1. Editors → Views, Tools, AudioCore
2. Views → Editors, TransportUI
3. Tools → Editors, AudioOps, MidiOps
4. TransportUI → AudioCore, ProjectMgmt

### Processing Dependencies
1. AudioOps → AudioCore, FileIO, Devices
2. MidiOps → AudioCore, FileIO, Devices
3. Scripts → All processing packages
4. Plugins → Devices, AudioOps, MidiOps

## Success Criteria

Each command category must:
1. Have corresponding implementation in the architecture
2. Support full undo/redo functionality
3. Integrate with the command system
4. Provide appropriate UI controls
5. Support keyboard shortcuts
6. Persist configuration appropriately
7. Handle errors gracefully
8. Maintain performance standards
