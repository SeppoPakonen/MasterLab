# Kick Shaping Suite Effect Stub

## Reference
- Inspired by: Kick Suite
- Vendor: W.A. Production
- Source catalog: Kick Shaper

## Implementation Plan
### W.A. Kick Shaper
- Category: dynamics
- Sidechain: N/A
- Processing blueprint: Specialized kick drum processor combining transient shaping, harmonic enhancement, and sub synthesis with macro controls.
- Key features:
  - Transient, body, and tail sections with independent EQ
  - Harmonic enhancer with odd/even blend and drive
  - Sub generator with frequency tracking and phase alignment
  - Limiter for clip-safe output and audition macros
- Core building blocks:
  - DSP::KickDetector, DSP::TransientDesigner, DSP::HarmonicEnhancer, DSP::SubSynth, DSP::OutputLimiter
- Signal/voice flow: Input → Section split (transient/body/tail) → Targeted enhancement blocks → Limiter → Output
- TODO:
  - Wire PluginSDK parameter/route scaffolding to match the modules above
  - Flesh out processing graph and automation surfaces per EFFECTS/INSTRUMENTS blueprint
