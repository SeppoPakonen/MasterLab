# Spectral Layers Fx Effect Stub

## Reference
- Inspired by: SpectraLayers FX
- Vendor: Steinberg
- Source catalog: SpectraLayers 10, SpectraLayers One

## Implementation Plan
### Steinberg SpectraLayers
- Category: restoration
- Sidechain: N/A
- Processing blueprint: Layer-based spectral editor integrating AI separation, manual painting, and ARA workflow inside the DAW.
- Key features:
  - Per-layer FFT resolution and phase-coherent resynthesis
  - AI-driven source separation (voice, drums, music, noise)
  - Selection tools (brush, harmonics, transient) with feathering
  - History layers and composite rendering back into host timeline
- Core building blocks:
  - DSP::SpectralEditor, DSP::LayerManager, DSP::AISeparator, DSP::SelectionBrush, DSP::PhaseResynth
- Signal/voice flow: Input → FFT analysis → Layer editing/processing → Resynthesis → Output
- TODO:
  - Wire PluginSDK parameter/route scaffolding to match the modules above
  - Flesh out processing graph and automation surfaces per EFFECTS/INSTRUMENTS blueprint
