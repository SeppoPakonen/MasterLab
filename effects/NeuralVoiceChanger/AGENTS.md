# Neural Voice Changer Effect Stub

## Reference
- Inspired by: Neural Voice
- Vendor: Replay
- Source catalog: Replay Neural Voice Changer

## Implementation Plan
### Replay Neural Voice Changer
- Category: vocal design
- Sidechain: N/A
- Processing blueprint: Real-time neural voice conversion engine turning source vocals into selectable voiceprints with low-latency streaming.
- Key features:
  - Voicebank management with speaker embeddings
  - Pitch/formant tracking with drift protection for expressive delivery
  - Latency-optimized streaming with predictive buffering for live use
  - Noise gate and de-noise stages to stabilize model input
- Core building blocks:
  - DSP::VoiceEncoder, DSP::VoiceDecoder, DSP::PitchTracker, DSP::LatencyResampler, DSP::NoiseGate
- Signal/voice flow: Input → Pitch/formant analysis → Neural conversion → Post conditioning (EQ/noise gate) → Output
- TODO:
  - Wire PluginSDK parameter/route scaffolding to match the modules above
  - Flesh out processing graph and automation surfaces per EFFECTS/INSTRUMENTS blueprint
