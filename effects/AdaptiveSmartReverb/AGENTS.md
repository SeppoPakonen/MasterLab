# Adaptive Smart Reverb Effect Stub

## Reference
- Inspired by: SmartReverb
- Vendor: Sonible
- Source catalog: SmartReverb

## Implementation Plan
### Sonible SmartReverb
- Category: reverb
- Sidechain: N/A
- Processing blueprint: AI-assisted reverb that adapts time-variant energy distribution to the source signal.
- Key features:
  - Source profiling with AI to derive energy vs time map
  - Interactive XY pad for rich/intimate and natural/artificial axes
  - Built-in damping, width, and transient recovery controls
  - Freeze and infinite sustain functions with dynamic damping
- Core building blocks:
  - DSP::AIReverbProfiler, DSP::EnergyMap, DSP::AdaptiveDecay, DSP::ReverbSynth, DSP::InteractivePad
- Signal/voice flow: Input → Source profiling → Energy map shaping → Adaptive reverb synthesis → Output
- TODO:
  - Wire PluginSDK parameter/route scaffolding to match the modules above
  - Flesh out processing graph and automation surfaces per EFFECTS/INSTRUMENTS blueprint
